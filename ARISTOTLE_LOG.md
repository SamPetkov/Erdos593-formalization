# Aristotle provenance log

## G1: private endpoint implies bridge

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-14 22:50
- Aristotle CLI: `aristotlelib 2.1.0`
- Aristotle project: `92385af1-34ca-4ad3-aee1-4f6ae2cabfa8`
- Aristotle task: `3a93fca3-3618-4f8b-a128-7f99279c805c`
- Initial status: `QUEUED`
- Prompt: `Follow TASK.md exactly and do not exceed its stated scope.`
- Scope: prove only `isBridge_of_adj_of_unique_neighbor` in
  `Erdos593/Graph/Bridge.lean`.
- Submitted directory: a fresh staging directory outside the Git worktree.
- Submitted files: `Erdos593.lean`, `Erdos593/Graph/Bridge.lean`,
  `lakefile.toml`, `lean-toolchain`, and `TASK.md` (2,036 bytes total).
- Sensitive-pattern scan: clear.
- Toolchain: Lean and mathlib `v4.32.0`.
- Service warning: Aristotle reported that it works best with Lean `v4.28.0`
  and that the staged directory had no `.lake` dependency directory.
- Returned archive SHA-256:
  `DD6FF956BDB02D1FE4FC1370D0916007B96A0BBDEE47F064558A3E37EC8246B0`.
- Archive path audit: eight relative paths; no absolute or parent-traversal path.
- Remote diff: only the marked proof changed among submitted source files.
- Compatibility repair: Aristotle resolved the project with mathlib `v4.28.0`,
  whose `IsBridge` definition includes edge membership.  In canonical `v4.32.0`,
  `IsBridge` is only endpoint non-reachability.  The proof was therefore adapted
  without changing the theorem statement: the obsolete adjacency conjunct was
  removed and `deleteEdges_adj` replaced the old set-difference adjacency API.
- Canonical verification: `lake build Erdos593.Graph.Bridge` succeeded; the
  source gap scan was clear; `#print axioms` reported exactly `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Accepted canonical file SHA-256:
  `2D2576A0B6C7C478F87C90AADDB48E04197A757FFE3232F3812B3E4D46014E2A`.
- Disposition: accepted after the documented Lean 4.32 API repair.

## G5: two-colourability from simple-cycle parity

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-14 23:25
- Aristotle CLI: `aristotlelib 2.1.0`
- Aristotle project: `75d077dd-965a-49fa-b231-8556386f7152`
- Aristotle task: `2528cf41-231f-4b1f-99d6-bafb706cd82c`
- Initial status: `QUEUED`
- Prompt: `Follow TASK.md exactly and do not exceed its stated scope.`
- Scope: prove only `two_colorable_iff_every_cycle_even` in
  `Erdos593/Graph/Parity.lean`.
- Submitted directory: a minimal Lean/mathlib `v4.28.0` staging directory
  outside the Git worktree.
- Version adaptation: the staging file imports the 4.28 module
  `SimpleGraph.ConcreteColorings`; the canonical 4.32 declaration imports
  `SimpleGraph.Coloring.Constructions`.  The theorem statement is identical,
  and only the proof body may be transplanted.
- Upload preview: six files, 4,676 bytes, with the SDK's own ignore rules.
- Sensitive-pattern scan: clear.
- Canonical acceptance condition: the returned proof must compile under the
  repository's Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0` project without changing the statement.
- Independent fallback: while the remote task remained in progress, a separate
  strong-induction proof was developed and checked locally. It splits every
  non-cycle closed walk at a nonempty closed subwalk of its tail and applies the
  induction hypothesis to the two strictly shorter closed walks.
- Canonical verification of fallback: `lake build Erdos593.Graph.Parity
  Erdos593` succeeded; `#print axioms` reported exactly `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Accepted canonical file SHA-256:
  `2146915B6213E1949A659F4A7C18245A534A271F8C0DCD371C708386C5E40995`.
- Remote status at local acceptance: still `IN_PROGRESS` after about one hour;
  the result was therefore removed from the canonical proof's critical path.
- Remote completion (UTC): 2026-07-15 00:56:11, reported `COMPLETE` at 100
  percent by the Aristotle CLI/SDK.
- Returned archive SHA-256:
  `BF5397D211CDA37CA98C2AF29357575360C1C6A3CAD696AF93B3196597B87C91`.
- Archive path audit: eight relative paths; no absolute or parent-traversal
  path.
- Aristotle's returned summary reports a successful 4.28 build and exactly the
  standard permitted axioms.  The proof uses a separate minimal-counterexample
  construction, explicit walk splitting, well-founded descent, and generated
  `grind` invocations.
- Adversarial comparison: the returned proof is materially longer and more
  API-sensitive than the already accepted direct strong-induction proof.  A
  bounded canonical 4.32 elaboration check did not complete within 64 seconds;
  because this proof is not being accepted, no portability adaptation was made.
- Disposition: Aristotle comparison reviewed and rejected in favor of the
  shorter canonical fallback; no returned source was merged.

## Final obstruction/classification fresh Aristotle request

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-18 21:03
- Aristotle CLI: `aristotlelib 2.1.0`
- Aristotle project: `e433cb77-aa16-418b-aaa5-565368b8af42`
- Aristotle task: `7a105082-bf63-4d4c-b853-7dae126afc63`
- Initial status: `QUEUED`
- Scope: complete the final finite obstruction/classification layer, with the
  odd-Berge-cycle obstruction as the primary target and the final
  `IsObligatory ↔ isolatedReduction.Intrinsic` theorem as the secondary target.
- Submitted directory: clean staging copy under `tmp/aristotle/` containing
  `Erdos593/`, `Erdos593.lean`, `lakefile.toml`, `lake-manifest.json`, and
  `lean-toolchain`; `.lake`, `formalization/tmp`, and scratch archives were not
  included.
- Service warning: Aristotle reported its usual preference for Lean `v4.28.0`
  and noted the intentionally omitted `.lake` dependency directory.
- Acceptance condition: any returned patch must compile in the canonical
  repository under Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`, with no `axiom`, `sorry`, `admit`, or
  `unsafe`.

## ShiftGraph chromatic descent focused Aristotle request

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-18 21:15
- Aristotle CLI: `aristotlelib 2.1.0`
- Aristotle project: `8024f6b3-a1bf-47b7-8b14-840e3edbc0b8`
- Aristotle task: `bdc5b255-d32e-43c7-8112-df720e6cfbc5`
- Initial status: `QUEUED`
- Local/public base SHA at submission:
  `92d62e424f30b9e0abf9e5b07caebf808abbaed3`.
- Scope: prove the missing iterated shift-graph chromatic/cardinal descent in
  `Erdos593/Graph/ShiftGraphChromatic.lean`, preferably
  `ShiftGraph.not_nonempty_coloring_nat_of_beth_lt`, and otherwise the
  strongest checked replacement endpoint that iterates `ShiftGraph.lowerColoring`
  to the one-tuple complete-graph base case. If the chromatic theorem lands,
  also package it for `SequenceLiftShiftObstruction`.
- Submitted directory: clean staging copy under `tmp/aristotle/` containing
  `Erdos593/`, `Erdos593.lean`, `lakefile.toml`, `lake-manifest.json`, and
  `lean-toolchain`; `.lake`, `formalization/tmp`, and scratch archives were not
  included.
- Service warning: Aristotle reported its usual preference for Lean `v4.28.0`
  and noted the intentionally omitted `.lake` dependency directory.
- Acceptance condition: any returned patch must compile in the canonical
  repository under Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`, with no `axiom`, `sorry`, `admit`,
  `unsafe`, resource-limit override, theorem weakening, or finite-colour
  replacement for the infinite/cardinal statement.

## F1: linearity of a private-vertex expansion

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 00:24
- Aristotle CLI: `aristotlelib 2.1.0`
- Aristotle project: `19530016-3fe7-421c-911c-5ed142394479`
- Aristotle task: `84fa32f0-1c8a-4088-b32f-b4c2cca6e5a0`
- Initial status: `QUEUED`; first poll: `IN_PROGRESS`.
- Prompt: `Follow TASK.md exactly and do not exceed its stated scope.`
- Scope: prove only `privateVertexExpansion_linear` in
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/ForwardExpansion.lean`.
- Submitted directory: a clean copy of an independently built Lean/mathlib
  `v4.28.0` staging directory outside the Git worktree; `.lake` was excluded
  from the upload.
- Upload manifest: eight files, 10,803 bytes.
- Sensitive-pattern scan: clear.
- Canonical acceptance condition: the returned proof must compile under the
  repository's Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0` project without changing the statement.
- Returned archive SHA-256:
  `AFBF745E1FB23E819E2A126A217BE2735DF32B2F0F042946DBB897C32AC5E03D`.
- Archive path audit: ten relative paths; no absolute or parent-traversal path.
- Remote diff: only the marked proof changed among submitted Lean source files.
- Compatibility repair: the remote proof compiled under canonical 4.32 but
  triggered the `unnecessarySeqFocus` linter. The same generated tactics were
  regrouped with `all_goals`, without changing the theorem statement or proof
  argument, to remove the warning.
- Canonical verification: `lake build
  Erdos593.TripleSystem.ForwardExpansion` succeeded without warnings; the source
  gap scan was clear; `#print axioms` reported exactly `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Accepted canonical file SHA-256:
  `C02222248B1E8EAA67724D648695CAD2F8EAA6733A584685384EDB7DFCC433C2`.
- Disposition: accepted after the documented non-logical linter repair.

- Submitted directory: a clean copy of an independently built Lean/mathlib
  `v4.28.0` staging directory outside the Git worktree; `.lake` was excluded
  from the upload.

  4.28 form of G1 because `SimpleGraph.IsBridge` changed in 4.32. Only the F2
  proof body may be transplanted into the canonical project.
- Upload manifest: eleven files, 15,198 bytes.
- Sensitive-pattern scan: clear.
- Canonical acceptance condition: the returned proof must compile under the
  repository's Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0` project without changing the statement.

- Version portability: the proof body was transplanted unchanged from 4.28 to
  the canonical 4.32 declaration.
- Independent comparison: a separately developed private-leaf proof had already
  compiled under 4.32; the returned proof uses the same argument more concisely.

  Erdos593.TripleSystem.ExpansionIntrinsic` succeeded; the source gap scan was
  clear; `#print axioms` reported exactly `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound`.

- Scope: prove only `contracted_edge_eq_of_edgeWitness_eq` and
  `edgeWitness_not_mem_liftWalk_support` in the staged
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/BridgeBlockCycleLift.lean`.
- Submitted directory: a sanitized Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0` source staging
  directory outside the Git worktree; build caches were excluded.
- Upload manifest: 25 files, 71,079 bytes. Deterministic sorted-tree SHA-256:
  `6305ED73FD0E33CED0C6237A754DE398B4662320721E1417A56ACB6790F21CC2`.
- Sensitive-pattern scan: clear. No manuscript, personal metadata,
  credentials, Git history, or local paths were submitted.
- Pre-submission validation: the exact target file elaborated under canonical
  Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`; its only warnings were the two expected marked
  `sorry` terms.
- Service compatibility warning: Aristotle currently recommends Lean 4.28.
  The task intentionally retains the canonical 4.32 statements and APIs;
  returned source is accepted only after an unchanged canonical build, source
  gap scan, and axiom audit.
- Independent fallback: while the remote task was in progress, the two helper
  proofs were completed locally.  Degree two identifies the unordered endpoint
  pair of an equal witness; an induction on the tail walk then excludes a
  forbidden witness from the lifted support.
- Canonical verification of fallback: `lake build
  Erdos593.TripleSystem.BridgeBlockCycleLift` succeeded (1209 jobs); the source
  gap scan and `git diff --check` were clear; axiom audits of both helpers and
  the public cycle-lift/parity theorems reported exactly `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Accepted canonical file SHA-256:
  `B271376BB03C29A6E3AB2ED238BC0AF3020E296A3576063703FB260F1E864FD0`.
- Remote status at final audit: `COMPLETE`.
- Returned archive: 19,991-byte gzip-compressed tar archive (despite the
  requested `.zip` suffix), SHA-256
  `A4D44569DC5FEA102FC13F03EFC7B4589E20D5C4932054B2AEF99F7D28C928B0`.
- Archive audit: 26 relative regular-file/directory entries, 75,041
  uncompressed bytes; no path traversal, links, special files, credentials,
  private keys, or unfinished-proof markers.
- Returned target SHA-256:
  `F53AD43111FDF198BFD6384DDB8374E2D4A2CF3678B021A06EF4EACCF928B4E1`.
  The target differs by 73 insertions and 87 deletions. Aristotle supplied
  sound alternative proofs for both marked helpers, but also removed the
  canonical module documentation and wrapped the public API in an extra
  `CycleLiftCheck` namespace.
- Canonical compatibility audit: the exact returned project built unchanged
  under Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0` (1209 jobs). Both helper theorems and the public
  cycle-lift theorem reported exactly `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound`.
- Disposition: Aristotle independently confirmed both obligations, but the
  returned file was rejected in favour of the already accepted canonical local
  proofs because the alternatives provide no needed improvement and its
  namespace/header changes would regress the module API.

## DU1--DU4: intrinsic preservation under disjoint union

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 05:42.
- Aristotle CLI: `aristotlelib 2.1.0`.
- Aristotle project: `8397c771-3a1f-48d3-8cd7-08710ac675e9`.
- Aristotle task: `f03b9b1d-4f9b-427a-b83b-ce45d9bda353`.
- Prompt: `Follow TASK.md exactly. Prove all four marked disjoint-union
  preservation declarations directly, and do not change their statements or
  surrounding API.`
- Exact scope: `disjointUnionLeviIso`,
  `disjointUnion_bridgeAtEveryEdge`, `disjointUnion_evenBergeCycles`, and
  `disjointUnion_intrinsic`, with their fixed public statements in
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/DisjointUnionForward.lean`.
- Submitted directory: an eleven-file sanitized Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0` source
  staging directory outside the Git worktree; build caches were excluded.
- Upload size: 19,916 bytes. Deterministic sorted-tree SHA-256:
  `C7D5317FEAFF86DECF2E366F0A5B39B1502D5C5B9303EAEA050706FC82E6AC82`.
- Sensitive-pattern scan: clear. No manuscript, personal metadata,
  credentials, Git history, absolute paths, or local build products were
  submitted.
- Pre-submission validation: the target built under canonical Lean/mathlib
  `v4.32.0`; its only diagnostics were the four expected marked `sorry`
  placeholders.
- Remote status at the 2026-07-15 06:05 UTC handoff: `IN_PROGRESS`. The task is
  retained only as an independent comparison because the exact obligations
  were completed locally while it ran.
- Local fallback: the canonical reassociation isomorphism identifies the Levi
  graph with a graph disjoint sum; reachability and bridge transfer are proved
  summandwise; a cycle is induced on its unique summand and mapped back with
  length and `IsCycle` preserved. The final theorem combines those results with
  `disjointUnion_linear`.
- Canonical-pinned verification: `lake build
  Erdos593.TripleSystem.DisjointUnionForward` succeeded without warnings (1193
  jobs). The source gap and secret scans and `git diff --check` were clear.
  `#print axioms` on all four public declarations reported exactly `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Accepted canonical file SHA-256:
  `332FC9A6691E955F32A8DBC3C0EFE029492C9F526A5254B6330BE6DC52226945`.
- Disposition: accepted from the independently audited local fallback; the
  still-running Aristotle result may only replace it after an unchanged 4.32
  build and API/diff audit.

## DU3S: isolated cycle-length transfer for a graph disjoint sum

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 05:59.
- Aristotle project: `eb5ce114-54a4-4951-90bf-191272c55292`.
- Aristotle task: `ce8d085c-7d50-411b-8423-f62ef07d8e04`.
- Prompt: `Follow TASK.md exactly. Prove the single generic cycle-length
  divisibility theorem for graph disjoint sums directly.`
- Scope: the exact generic theorem `cycle_length_dvd_sum` in `CycleSum.lean`:
  if every cycle length in each factor is divisible by `n`, then every cycle
  length in their graph disjoint sum is divisible by `n`.
- Submitted directory: five sanitized source/configuration files outside the
  Git worktree, 4,613 bytes. Deterministic sorted-tree SHA-256:
  `213790BC5F839EAE7C83DBA08D2AEBDB9C0293141206EA149F6A6DFD15F69A65`.
- Pre-submission canonical check: `lake env lean CycleSum.lean` succeeded with
  exactly the single marked placeholder warning; the sensitive-pattern scan
  was clear.
- Remote status at the 2026-07-15 06:05 UTC handoff: `IN_PROGRESS`.
- Local result: the helper obligation was independently discharged inside the
  accepted canonical DU3 proof before the split task returned.
- Disposition: independent comparison only; no returned code has been merged.

## R5/R6: private points and active bridge-block expansion data

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 05:44:16.
- Aristotle CLI: `aristotlelib 2.1.0`.
- Aristotle project: `1ea7c247-a8f6-4ddb-813b-cddfe4cc4f06`.
- Aristotle task: `dfcd218e-ca86-4829-b0f5-b339676e8eb3`.
- Prompt: `Follow TASK.md exactly. Prove all six fixed reverse bridge-block
  expansion declarations directly; preserve every statement and the public
  API.`
- Scope: prove exactly the six marked declarations
  `contractibleEdge_existsUnique_privatePoint`, `privatePoint_isBridge`,
  `privatePoint_not_mem_component`, `privatePoint_injective`,
  `inc_iff_bridgeFree_or_privatePoint`, and
  `activeComponent_privateVertexExpansionData` in
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/BridgeBlockExpansion.lean`.
- Submitted directory: a fresh sanitized Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0` source staging
  directory outside the Git worktree. Upload manifest: 25 files, 78,419 bytes.
- Sensitive-pattern scan: clear. No manuscript, personal metadata,
  credentials, Git history, build cache, or local path was submitted.
- Pre-submission validation: all six fixed statements elaborated under the
  canonical toolchain; the only warnings were their six intentional marked
  `sorry` terms.
- Service warning: Aristotle recommends Lean 4.28 and reported that the
  source-only staging directory had no `.lake` dependency cache. Canonical
  4.32 compilation remains the acceptance condition.
- Independent fallback: while the direct task ran, all six declarations were
  proved locally in dependency order. The proof counts the unique deleted
  neighbour, recovers its bridge membership, excludes it from the component,
  applies bridge-edge uniqueness to obtain private-point injectivity, and then
  packages the exact surviving-core-or-private incidence dichotomy for every
  hyperedge of an active component.
- Canonical verification of fallback: `lake build
  Erdos593.TripleSystem.BridgeBlockExpansion` succeeded (1210 jobs); the full
  Lean source gap scan and `git diff --check` were clear; all six theorem axiom
  audits reported exactly `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Local handoff file SHA-256:
  `F67AB7A941764AE0B4660707151182779291F107DC0D96FE6E6F1452DA1E928D`.
- Final packaging repair: the module-private abbreviation `B` was renamed to
  `expansionCore` to avoid a private-name collision when all source modules are
  concatenated. No public declaration, theorem statement, or proof changed.
  The focused module check and the 2,898-line one-file check both passed.
- Final accepted canonical file SHA-256:
  `71CC3AFF8A6262D199C09F62B0B52BE5B076379BD728D2ECD388CE3158E298C7`.
- Remote status at local acceptance: `IN_PROGRESS`. The eventual Aristotle
  return remains an independent comparison and must undergo the same archive,
  API, gap, and canonical-build audit before any returned proof is considered.
- Disposition: the gap-free canonical local proofs are accepted; no remote
  source has been merged.

## G7: bridge-component quotient is a forest

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 05:44:16.
- Aristotle CLI: `aristotlelib 2.1.0`.
- Aristotle project: `d2fe6b3f-ae95-4930-8001-ac71cdad7b83`.
- Aristotle task: `b1b6acfc-0003-4d27-87cb-684732220709`.
- Prompt: `Follow TASK.md exactly. Prove the direct quotient-walk lifting lemma
  and the quotient-forest theorem without changing their statements or any
  completed source.`
- Scope: fill only `reachable_delete_of_bridgeQuotient_walk` and
  `bridgeQuotient_isAcyclic` in the staged
  `Erdos593/Graph/BridgeQuotient.lean`. The quotient definition, adjacency
  characterization, cross-component bridge theorem, and original-edge
  uniqueness theorem were supplied already proved.
- Submitted directory: a fresh sanitized Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0` staging
  directory outside the Git worktree. It contained two Lean source files,
  `lakefile.toml`, `lake-manifest.json`, `lean-toolchain`, and `TASK.md`.
- Sensitive-pattern scan: clear. No manuscript, personal metadata,
  credentials, Git history, or local paths were submitted.
- Pre-submission validation: the exact target file elaborated under canonical
  Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0` with only the two intended marked `sorry` terms.
- Service warning: Aristotle recommends Lean 4.28 and noted that build caches
  were excluded. Canonical 4.32 acceptance is therefore mandatory.
- Independent fallback: while the remote task was in progress, both proofs
  were completed locally. A quotient walk avoiding one quotient edge is lifted
  component by component to an original walk avoiding the unique bridge over
  that edge. Consequently every quotient adjacency is a bridge, so the
  quotient is acyclic.
- Canonical verification: `lake build Erdos593.Graph.BridgeQuotient` succeeded
  (1188 jobs), followed by the full `lake build Erdos593` (1222 jobs). Gap and
  sensitive-pattern scans were clear. `#print axioms` for all five core
  declarations reported exactly `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Accepted canonical file SHA-256 after the accompanying G8 helper:
  `3D4E7BFAB70EF7DCB4ACFA58D65782A5971DF0568FFC437C5264C6DF9BDF9F63`.
- Remote completion audit (UTC 2026-07-15 06:30): `COMPLETE`.
- Returned archive: 5,235-byte gzip-compressed tar archive, SHA-256
  `A4744CB1A2FCAA500BB04370EDA61F0619993DA87E041F6057FAE574B99B0889`.
  Its eight entries are relative regular files (17,631 uncompressed bytes),
  with no traversal, links, special files, credentials, or proof gaps.
- Returned target SHA-256:
  `E82FFE0F4FF86B0C6CF540DC527812D69FF14267779E065CAB309692B4CCE7C2`.
  The source/API diff changes exactly the two requested proof bodies; every
  other submitted source and configuration file is byte-identical.
- Canonical compatibility audit: every returned Lean source elaborated
  unchanged under the repository's Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0` dependencies. The
  returned summary reports exactly `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and
  `Quot.sound` for the target proofs.
- Adversarial comparison: Aristotle found the same component-by-component walk
  lift and bridge contradiction as the accepted local proof. Its variant is not
  materially stronger or clearer and supplies no additional API.
- Disposition: independently confirmed and rejected for merge in favour of the
  already audited canonical local proof.

## G8/G9: closed-star and rooted-depth running-intersection helpers

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 05:51:42.
- Aristotle CLI: `aristotlelib 2.1.0`.
- Aristotle project: `f2d04d4c-6080-4ef7-a81f-d07216e4f9ec`.
- Aristotle task: `561047af-85a4-47e6-9c65-73b30e0e00ab`.
- Prompt: `Follow TASK.md exactly. Prove the two direct closed-star and
  rooted-depth helper theorems without changing any statement or completed
  source.`
- Scope: prove only `eq_or_bridgeQuotient_adj_of_adj_mem_supp` and the existing
  `closedStar_earlier_direction`, with their canonical statements unchanged.
- Submitted directory: a fresh sanitized Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0` staging
  directory outside the Git worktree. Sensitive-pattern scan: clear.
- Canonical status before submission: both theorem statements and their local
  proofs elaborated under 4.32. The first has also been specialized as
  `component_eq_or_leviBridgeQuotient_adj_of_inc`, the exact Levi-incidence
  closed-star kernel needed by the later active-piece packaging.
- Canonical verification: the changed contraction module elaborated cleanly;
  the full `Erdos593` target built without warnings. The graph declarations use
  only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Remote completion audit (UTC 2026-07-15 06:30): `COMPLETE`.
- Returned archive: 5,957-byte gzip-compressed tar archive, SHA-256
  `925DF872FFAB97DFC8C4D6DFF0A5BAA98C4933161126EB7D39DBE26EE4B9218A`.
  Its nine entries are relative regular files (20,588 uncompressed bytes), with
  no traversal, links, special files, credentials, or proof gaps.
- Returned target SHA-256 values:

  `A958EC47FE46AF044450AED3C241FC4FB9DA2E8D6652F5253FDEA3D9457FB33C`
  for `RootedTree.lean`.
- Source/API diff: exactly the two requested proof bodies changed; all theorem
  statements, imports, namespaces, documentation, completed proofs, and other
  submitted files are byte-identical.
- Canonical compatibility audit: all three returned Lean source files
  elaborated unchanged under the repository's Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`
  dependencies. The returned summary reports only the permitted standard
  axioms.
- Adversarial comparison: the returned closed-star proof is equivalent to the
  accepted local proof, while the returned rooted-depth proof is only
  `grind +suggestions`; the canonical explicit geometric proof is more
  auditable and API-stable.
- Disposition: independently confirmed; no returned code merged.

## F3/F4: parity and intrinsic conditions for private-vertex expansions

- Direct submission (UTC): 2026-07-15 06:53.
- Aristotle CLI: `aristotlelib 2.1.0`.
- Direct project: `ee5b3a7f-d208-4fdc-8a37-24021eb85edb`.
- Direct task: `f6ea8655-070f-4323-aa77-57bd5492ad75`.
- Direct prompt: `Follow TASK.md exactly. Prove the exact F3 forward-parity
  theorem directly, preserve F4 and every completed declaration, and run all
  required checks.`
- Exact direct target: for arbitrary `V` and `G : SimpleGraph V`, prove
  `G.Colorable 2 → (privateVertexExpansion G).EvenBergeCycles`; F4 then
  packages F1, F2, and F3 as `(privateVertexExpansion G).Intrinsic`. No
  finiteness hypothesis is needed.
- Direct staging: a fresh sanitized Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0` source directory
  outside the Git worktree, containing thirteen files (the target and its exact
  custom import closure, project configuration, root import, and `TASK.md`).
  It contained exactly one intended `sorry`; the sensitive-pattern scan was
  clear. The API key was read only from the Windows User environment and was
  neither printed nor persisted.
- Service warning: Aristotle recommends Lean 4.28 and noted that the source-only
  upload excluded `.lake`. Canonical 4.32 verification is mandatory.
- Independent split submissions (UTC): 2026-07-15 07:02. The two genuine proof
  boundaries were submitted concurrently, each in a separate sanitized
  twelve-file 4.32 source stage with exactly one intended `sorry` and a clear
  sensitive-pattern scan:
  - F3A, `privateVertex_not_mem_cycle_support`: project
    `681388d0-b970-49a7-9b87-8e2f29ad55bf`, task
    `aa0f2736-f046-48d7-9331-ca0100cd4e2d`.
  - F3B, `exists_graph_walk_of_privateVertexExpansion_walk`: project
    `f1e54809-71d7-43f2-b67e-093cc0977399`, task
    `1e0ef4cd-056c-4d87-93cc-c98e0feb0fc9`.
- Independent local proof: F3A shows that the unique Levi edge at a private
  point is a bridge and invokes the bridge/cycle characterization. F3B consumes
  a private-free core-to-core Levi trail two steps at a time, uses trailness to
  distinguish the two core endpoints of each graph edge, and constructs a graph
  walk of exactly half the length. F3 rotates a Levi cycle to a core node,
  applies F3B, and transfers parity from the supplied two-colouring.
- Canonical verification: direct elaboration of
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/ForwardExpansion.lean` succeeded without warnings;
  `lake build Erdos593.TripleSystem.ForwardExpansion` succeeded (1208 jobs).
  The complete Lean source gap scan, sensitive-pattern scan, and
  `git diff --check` were clear. Axiom audits of F1, F3A, F3B, F3, and F4 each
  reported exactly `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Aggregate-build note: a concurrent `lake build Erdos593` reached 1223/1225
  jobs and then failed at the root entry point because a separately added,
  untracked imported module `IsomorphIntrinsic` had no object file. The focused
  forward-expansion module itself had already built successfully; this transient
  shared-worktree failure is outside F3/F4. After that concurrent module landed,
  the aggregate canonical build passed all 1227 jobs on 2026-07-15.
- Accepted canonical file SHA-256:
  `F2D0E538C25698185822D5ECE04308F194AB07900EA2E29FAE09A385F779D1A2`.
- Remote status at local acceptance: all three tasks were `IN_PROGRESS`. Their
  eventual returns remain independent comparisons and require archive, source
  diff, gap, API, and unchanged canonical 4.32 audits before consideration.
- Direct and F3A completion audit (UTC 2026-07-15 07:26): both tasks reported
  `COMPLETE`; F3B remained `IN_PROGRESS` and was no longer on the critical path.
  The direct archive has fifteen safe relative regular-file entries, SHA-256
  `EF5F89552225475BDBFD03735739412E64598366AD790C0F181923B58EBFC995`;
  its returned target SHA-256 is
  `5CDBE970C2A61F1E26683B12DDBBB9686934BB68EBC8F98E527A9940F2EE1677`.
  The F3A archive has fourteen safe relative regular-file entries, SHA-256
  `9DFC954D9FC17026D88B9B0B9E719CF9EB1AD956A6DE740A703CC8C092FFBBAD`;
  its returned target SHA-256 is
  `2E8CD7C230E381E9505350E45F82B1D6331D2C56503B623FD323C16A1E650532`.
  Neither archive contains traversal paths, links, special files, credentials,
  sensitive patterns, or unfinished-proof markers. In each return, exactly the
  requested target differs among submitted files.
- Canonical return compatibility: both exact returned target files elaborated
  unchanged against the repository's Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0` dependencies. The
  direct return independently found the same rotation, private-point exclusion,
  two-step contraction, and parity argument; its helpers are private and its
  proof is not materially stronger than the accepted public-helper API. The
  split F3A return relies primarily on generated `grind` calls and is less
  explicit than the accepted bridge/cycle proof.
- Disposition: the exact, gap-free canonical local proofs are accepted; no
  remote source was merged. The direct and F3A returns independently confirm
  the result but provide no needed improvement. The redundant F3B task was
  cancelled on 2026-07-15 to release an Aristotle concurrency slot for an open
  classification obligation.

## O2/R7--R11: closing the finite structural classification

- One-point-amalgamation bridge submission: project
  `f03f7ba6-1fc4-49a5-87e4-f47fc646e6f6`, task
  `2030dd2b-c3f9-430b-befd-e01b82bc99e7`.
- Generic cut-vertex cycle helper: project
  `803e1f95-516b-4c16-8fa4-5eaf4c240dd7`, task
  `e3ad8b64-7c62-427b-b8ce-e8b17f17808c`. The returned helper was complete,
  independently recompiled under the canonical Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`
  environment, and used only after source, gap, API, and axiom audits.
- Redundant direct-cycle and factor-cycle submissions were cancelled after the
  exact local theorem and the generic cut-vertex helper closed the obligation:
  task `97c22c61-1793-46f4-8ec6-314dd37ae1ed` and task
  `88a0bcb4-2d86-46ba-9d8d-5c3e4d0a4e89`.
- Reverse-packaging combined submission: project
  `31bcb7ae-1fd4-4351-a73c-99e7f97fba37`, task
  `32af8114-f2e9-427d-944c-8554b085d92c`.
- P1 edge-packaging submission: project
  `44cb0239-47f0-44bb-9c3d-eca7762425fc`, task
  `37e08147-d500-4edb-b4a2-13f8d4bf5903`.
- P3 restriction-isomorphism submission: project
  `aa29c52e-469b-4cf2-8c6c-a9d2d144e320`, task
  `ac3107ac-dc4d-461e-bfba-a372f33a2d63`. The P1 and P3 returns completed and
  were independently recompiled. The accepted repository implementation uses
  the stronger local packaging API needed by the running-intersection consumer.
- Degree-zero component submission: project
  `355c5ea2-1037-43b3-97c5-824a6513a2c7`, task
  `b181d69c-0fe9-4f89-92eb-7e290a8e031d`. It was still queued when the local
  exact singleton-edge restriction proof was completed and audited, so no
  unverified remote source was needed.
- A temporary bridge-selector probe compiled at 418 physical lines, SHA-256
  `5e25e96dafa084c38a6bae748e32416b9965561819d265dbbd535eb2cd0acb79`.
  Its result is retained only as the small `BridgeSelector` compatibility
  interface; the exact all-bridges decomposition remains the main reverse proof.
- Canonical completion: `lake build Erdos593` passed all 1,244 jobs. The exact
  imported closure contains 40 modules, and the regenerated self-contained file
  contains 6,737 physical lines. Gap and secret scans were clear. Audited public
  endpoints report only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Disposition: the finite theorem is now closed exactly as
  `Constructible F.isolatedReduction ↔ F.isolatedReduction.Intrinsic`. Remote
  results were treated as candidate proofs rather than trusted artifacts, and
  only canonically recompiled, independently audited material influenced the
  accepted source.

## O6: rainbow bipartite submatrices (manuscript Lemma 3.1)

- Local acceptance date: 2026-07-15.
- Aristotle CLI: `aristotlelib 2.1.0`.
- Exact full-theorem submission: project
  `77506440-18a5-4813-b4b0-e492d2a22e13`, task
  `822fe881-1688-4695-bbe1-d67c3fb7df4f`.
- Independent counting-helper submission: project
  `e36b8617-f2f1-4b2a-b97a-ef5e2202174b`, task
  `09c5efd1-251f-4e55-834c-a2284a18e5b8`.
- Exact boundary: for every positive `n,t`, and every colour type, a colouring
  `Fin q → Fin q → Γ` in which every colour fiber at every left and
  right vertex has cardinality below `t` contains injective selections
  `Fin n ↪ Fin q` on both sides whose `n²` selected colours are pairwise
  distinct.
- Accepted proof: sample the `2n` row/column coordinates with replacement.
  The finite bad-index type contains ordered row collisions, ordered column
  collisions, and ordered pairs of edge positions with equal colour.  Every
  event has at most `t * q^(2n-1)` assignments: after all other coordinates
  are fixed, one coordinate has at most one choice for a vertex collision and
  fewer than `t` choices for a colour collision.  Taking
  `q = Fintype.card (BadIndex n) * t + 1` makes the union bound strict.
- Reusable local helpers: `Counting.exists_avoiding_of_event_card_le` and
  `Counting.card_function_event_le_of_fiber_le`.
- Canonical audit: the final repository module compiled directly and through
  `lake build Erdos593.Graph.RainbowBipartite` under Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`;
  the focused Lake build passed all 994 jobs. Gap and credential scans were
  clear. The accepted source SHA-256 is
  `FDE7EBD29E5337707C3F953A01F612B5E7B8219F2E1F20580C93248E49C19820`.
  The two helpers and the exact endpoint depend only on `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Remote status at local acceptance: the full-theorem task remained
  `IN_PROGRESS`. The counting-helper task later reported `COMPLETE`. Its
  downloaded gzip-compressed tar archive has six safe relative regular-file
  entries, archive SHA-256
  `D97AABBEFB525B2AEC3DB69AAE087A70DA7D4AF9E2D3C5A307585759A2D0D06D`,
  and returned `CountingHelpers.lean` SHA-256
  `3D5DF682122E0E0CE9F0B69C5DB6A8875416AA148618800ADB0F669F63E55C9D`.
  The returned logical statements match the fixed helper boundaries; source,
  traversal, special-file, gap, `implemented_by`, and credential scans were
  clear, and the unchanged returned source compiled under canonical 4.32.
  Its direct finite-sum-bijection proof is substantially more automation-heavy
  than the accepted explicit sigma/fiber proof, so it was retained only as an
  independent confirmation and not merged. Any eventual full-theorem return
  likewise remains an independent comparison until its archive, source,
  statement, gap, and canonical 4.32 compatibility are audited.

## O7: rooted abundance and obligatory one-point amalgamation

- Local acceptance date: 2026-07-15.
- Exact full-theorem submission: project
  `025413b9-851c-4d1b-95df-54cf05ea3fbc`, task
  `c59a9c71-7cb9-4803-8650-2e5f913428b5`.
- Sanitized staging audit: 52 files, 317,525 bytes, exactly one intended
  placeholder at the target theorem, and no credential matches.
- Returned archive SHA-256:
  `749455997B571002D62039C36A8C38C0D6219F8134464BAAA582A40D865DEBAF`.
  It contained 54 regular relative files, with no traversal, absolute path, or
  symlink entry. Relative to the submitted stage, only the target Lean theorem
  changed; the added summary files and all unchanged configuration/dependency
  files were rejected from the canonical tree.
- Canonical audit: the returned proof body was transplanted only into
  `IsObligatory.onePointAmalgamation`, retaining the repository's surrounding
  documentation and linter wrapper. It is byte-for-byte identical to the
  audited returned body after newline normalization. `lake build
  Erdos593.TripleSystem.ObligatoryOnePointAmalgamation` passed all 1,116 focused
  jobs under Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`.
- Source-gap, secret, and trailing-whitespace scans were clear. The exact final
  endpoint and its rooted-abundance helper report only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Accepted canonical file SHA-256:
  `C0F8C2C4C2CC955308526B741C06998A2F9646D3702B8A4C731DA293F9E151C6`.
- Disposition: accepted; only the verified theorem body was merged.

## O8: one-apex sequence-lift chromatic obstruction

- Local acceptance date: 2026-07-15.
- Exact full-theorem comparison submission: project
  `ab708cd7-75ec-477b-a008-03af21ca51e4`, task
  `ce44d44d-9972-48a4-b3b3-eccef16b3815`.
- Sanitized staging audit: 11 files, 32,857 bytes, tree SHA-256
  `80c3d2c442f8ece093c584eae3ec3aba6986e55dd6dec0ef50fff2ee54a360b2`,
  one intended target placeholder, and no credential matches.
- Local proof: `not_isProperColoring_nat` recursively builds an `ω₁`-branch
  from a hypothetical proper countable colouring, and
  `aleph0_lt_chromaticCardinal` derives the cardinal lower bound. The focused
  canonical `SequenceLiftChromatic` build passed under Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`.
- Remote status at the last successful poll: `IN_PROGRESS`. No remote source
  has been merged; any return remains subject to archive, exact-statement,
  source-gap, secret, and canonical 4.32 axiom audits.

## U1: complete-bipartite expansion atom

- Exact full-theorem comparison submission: project
  `4e668b7a-f140-4148-8e5a-d701f38cade7`, task
  `4fa61ce3-bb25-47b3-8022-7f33ac514648`.
- Boundary: a non-countably-colourable graph contains a balanced finite
  complete-bipartite copy, supplying the remaining positive expansion atom.
- Remote status at the last successful poll: `IN_PROGRESS`. No remote archive
  or proof body has been accepted; the local graph infrastructure is retained
  as a separate, gap-free foundation.

## O12: canonical base node for sequence-lift edges

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 16:58. Aristotle web-dashboard request
  `fe3dd927-3856-440f-9add-2f3548d39cd7`; the authenticated dashboard did not
  expose a separate project identifier for this text-only request.
- Exact task boundary: return only the complete new module
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/SequenceLiftBaseNode.lean`, with the supplied import,
  definitions, theorem signatures, and proof route for `BasedAt`, displayed
  base-node uniqueness, `Classical.choose` selection, and `baseNode_mkEdge`.
  It requires `lake env lean -DwarningAsError=true
  Erdos593/TripleSystem/SequenceLiftBaseNode.lean` and forbids `sorry`,
  `admit`, `axiom`, `unsafe`, and new global assumptions.
- Submitted files: none. The dashboard received only the explicit theorem
  prompt and local API context; no repository tree, attachment, credential, or
  secret was uploaded.
- Local independent implementation: the same exact module was developed and
  accepted before the remote job left its queue. Canonical targeted checks pass:
  `lake build Erdos593.TripleSystem.SequenceLiftBaseNode` (975 focused jobs)
  and the strict source command above under Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`.
- Local source audit: the module is clear of `sorry`, `admit`, project `axiom`,
  `unsafe`, and `sorryAx`; its only choice principle is the explicitly scoped
  `Classical.choose` in `baseNode`.
- Remote status at the last poll: `QUEUED`. No returned source has been merged;
  any result remains subject to exact-statement, source-gap, and canonical 4.32
  compilation audit before comparison or adoption.
- Disposition: local canonical proof accepted; remote proof retained as an
  independent pending comparison.

## O13: canonical normal forms for sequence-lift edges

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 17:32:54. Aristotle web-dashboard request
  `9cabd786-979e-4bbe-b678-245d50a4065a`; the authenticated dashboard did not
  expose a separate project identifier for this text-only request.
- Exact task boundary: return only the complete new module
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/SequenceLiftBaseNormalForm.lean`, with the supplied
  import, theorem signatures, and proof route for canonical displayed
  representations, the pointwise base-node characterization, non-base fibre
  uniqueness, and the exact canonical-base fibre. It requires `lake env lean
  -DwarningAsError=true Erdos593/TripleSystem/SequenceLiftBaseNormalForm.lean`
  and forbids `sorry`, `admit`, `axiom`, `unsafe`, and new global assumptions.
- Submitted files: none. The dashboard received only the explicit theorem
  prompt and local API context; no repository tree, attachment, credential, or
  secret was uploaded.
- Local independent implementation: the same exact module was developed and
  strictly accepted before the remote job began. The release audit is retained
  locally; no remote source has been considered for merging.
- Remote status at the first successful dashboard poll: `RUNNING`. No returned
  source has been merged; any result remains subject to exact-statement,
  source-gap, and canonical Lean 4.32 compilation audits before comparison or
  adoption.
- Disposition: local proof pending release validation; remote proof retained as
  an independent running comparison.

## O14: canonical base letter and linear trace key

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 17:53:27. Aristotle web-dashboard request
  `6c293fda-8907-437c-bb30-d23aa50f8be7`; the authenticated dashboard did not
  expose a separate project identifier for this text-only request.
- Exact task boundary: return an independent Lean 4 formalization of the
  bounded `SequenceLiftBaseLetter` API: base-letter existence and uniqueness,
  its `Classical.choose` selector, the canonical `(baseNode, baseLetter)` key,
  and injectivity of that key on every linear edge restriction. The prompt
  explicitly excluded any claim of a global finite-trace decomposition and
  highlighted the dependent transport required when canonical base nodes are
  equal. It forbids `sorry`, `admit`, `axiom`, `unsafe`, and new global
  assumptions.
- Submitted files: none. The dashboard received only the explicit theorem
  prompt and local API context; no repository tree, attachment, credential, or
  secret was uploaded.
- Local independent implementation: the same bounded module has a passing
  strict source check under Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`:
  `lake env lean -DwarningAsError=true
  Erdos593/TripleSystem/SequenceLiftBaseLetter.lean`.
- Remote status at the first successful dashboard poll: `RUNNING`. No returned
  source has been merged; any result remains subject to exact-statement,
  source-gap, and canonical Lean 4.32 compilation audits before comparison or
  adoption.
- Disposition: local proof pending release validation; remote proof retained as
  an independent running comparison.

## O25: tagged base-letter equivalence for embedded source edges

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 21:07. The authenticated Aristotle dashboard
  displayed the text-only task at 2026-07-16 00:07 local time and did not
  expose a standalone project or task identifier in the visible card.
- Exact task boundary: independently validate only
  `SequenceLift.edgeIndexEquiv_sigmaBaseLetterImage_of_linear`: under
  linearity of an embedding image, compose the exact source-edge/image
  equivalence with the existing tagged selected-edge/base-letter sigma
  equivalence. The prompt explicitly forbade a global base-letter union,
  cross-fibre identification, finite-cardinality claim, trace decomposition,
  `sorry`, `admit`, `axiom`, `unsafe`, and new global assumptions.
- Submitted files: none. The dashboard received only the public repository
  reference and bounded theorem prompt; no local tree, attachment, credential,
  secret, or private project content was uploaded.
- Local independent implementation: the exact focused module
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/SequenceLiftTaggedBaseLetterSourceEquiv.lean`
  was independently written and accepted before the remote job left its
  queue. Its strict source check and focused canonical build (1,231 Lake jobs)
  pass under Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`.
- Remote status: `FINISHED` successfully. In a fresh clone of the public
  repository's `main` at `7a553ad487d71740fd38835237f535ae362dc464`,
  Aristotle independently accepted the exact supplied O25 module with the
  strict warnings-as-errors check and printed only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`. Its module scan found no `sorry`,
  `admit`, project `axiom`, `unsafe`, `native_decide`, or resource-limit
  override. It did not modify or push the clone. The remote result is an
  independent validation of the pre-merge source, not a replacement for the
  local canonical build and source-gap audits.
- Disposition: local canonical proof accepted; Aristotle independently
  validated the pre-merge source, and no remote source was merged.

## O27: tagged apex-image equivalence for selected edges

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 21:49:02. The authenticated Aristotle dashboard
  request is `17bdeb15-b201-4c71-912f-227e6c772595`.
- Exact task boundary: independently validate only
  `SequenceLift.selectedEdgeEquiv_sigmaBaseApexImage_of_linear` from public
  `main`: under linearity, compose the selected-edge/base-fibre sigma
  equivalence with the individual canonical-apex-image equivalences. The
  prompt requires retaining the active base-node sigma tag and explicitly
  forbids an untagged union, cross-fibre apex identification, any
  finiteness/cardinality consequence, trace decomposition, atom theorem,
  `sorry`, `admit`, project `axiom`, `unsafe`, `native_decide`, and
  resource-limit overrides.
- Submitted files: none. The dashboard received only the public repository
  reference and exact bounded theorem prompt; no local tree, attachment,
  credential, secret, or private project content was uploaded.
- Local independent implementation: the exact focused module
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/SequenceLiftTaggedBaseApexEquiv.lean` was committed
  on public `main` at `22fa0ae04db9fb34e7b45d0e94a22c6acacc2a18`. Its strict
  source check and focused canonical build (1,233 Lake jobs) pass under
  Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`; its axiom audit reports only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Remote status: validation started. No returned source has been merged; any
  result remains subject to the exact-statement, source-gap, and canonical
  Lean 4.32 compilation audit before comparison or adoption.
- Disposition: local canonical proof accepted; remote proof retained as an
  independent pending validation.

## O28: embedded-source tagged apex-image equivalence

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 22:01:09. The authenticated Aristotle dashboard
  request is `2257205a-571d-452d-b34c-e9b88958a429`.
- Exact task boundary: independently validate only
  `SequenceLift.edgeIndexEquiv_sigmaBaseApexImage_of_linear` from public
  `main`: compose `f.edgeImageEdgeEquiv` with the O27 tagged
  selected-edge/base-fibre canonical-apex-image equivalence. The prompt
  requires retaining the active base-node sigma tag and explicitly forbids
  an untagged union, cross-fibre apex identification, any
  finiteness/cardinality consequence, trace decomposition, atom theorem,
  `sorry`, `admit`, project `axiom`, `unsafe`, `native_decide`, and
  resource-limit overrides.
- Submitted files: none. The dashboard received only the public repository
  reference and exact bounded theorem prompt; no local tree, attachment,
  credential, secret, or private project content was uploaded.
- Local independent implementation: the exact focused module
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/SequenceLiftTaggedBaseApexSourceEquiv.lean` was
  committed on public `main` at `2082a4746605471716f0c868e188c6331011320b`.
  Its strict source check and focused canonical build (1,234 Lake jobs) pass
  under Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`; its axiom audit reports only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.
- Remote status: validation started. No returned source has been merged; any
  result remains subject to the exact-statement, source-gap, and canonical
  Lean 4.32 compilation audit before comparison or adoption.
- Disposition: local canonical proof accepted; remote proof retained as an
  independent pending validation.

## O29: full classical positive-atom endpoint audit

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 22:15. The authenticated Aristotle dashboard
  request is `546cba75-21c1-46a5-b947-1f061036536d`.
- Exact task boundary: independently validate only
  `Erdos593.TripleSystem.completeBipartiteExpansionAtom_positive_isObligatory`
  in `Erdos593/TripleSystem/PositiveAtomClassical.lean`, from public `main`
  at `805d18c2bee543fdb00f1452559df42e890f3f5f`. The prompt requires audit
  of the cardinal-minimal bad-host reduction, local countable chromaticity,
  low-pair closure layering at `2 * n + n * n`, the assembled `Nat`
  colouring, and the `ULift.up`/`ULift.down` conversion to
  `CountableColor`. It explicitly limits the claim to the positive balanced
  atom endpoint and forbids presenting it as a global trace or classification
  theorem.
- Submitted files: none. The dashboard received only the public repository
  reference and bounded theorem prompt; no local tree, attachment, credential,
  secret, or private project content was uploaded.
- Local independent verification: the exact target source check with
  warnings-as-errors passes, and its focused canonical build completes
  successfully (1,511 Lake jobs) under Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`. Its axiom
  audit reports only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`; the
  applicable project source scan finds no `sorry`, `admit`, project `axiom`,
  `unsafe`, `native_decide`, or resource-limit override.
- Remote status: `QUEUED`. No returned source has been merged; any result
  remains subject to exact-statement, source-gap, and canonical Lean 4.32
  compilation audit before comparison or adoption.
- Disposition: local canonical endpoint remains accepted within its stated
  scope; remote work is retained only as an independent pending validation.

## O30: source-indexed canonical-apex fibre equivalence

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 22:23. The authenticated Aristotle dashboard
  request is `61850afc-f848-45a1-82fe-2dbd1b60c118`.
- Exact task boundary: independently validate only
  `SequenceLift.baseFiberIndexEquivBaseFiber` and
  `SequenceLift.baseFiberIndexEquivBaseApexImage_of_linear` in
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/SequenceLiftBaseFiberIndexApexEquiv.lean`, from
  public `main` at `6914430848931c76b48a3b0a55eeff535743f347`. The prompt
  requires audit of the range-equality orientation, `f.edge_injective`,
  the fixed base-node tag, and universe discipline; it explicitly forbids
  every global apex-union, cross-fibre, cardinality, trace, atom, or
  classification claim.
- Submitted files: none. The dashboard received only the public repository
  reference and bounded declaration prompt; no local tree, attachment,
  credential, secret, or private project content was uploaded.
- Local independent verification: the exact source check with
  warnings-as-errors passes, as does its focused canonical build (1,229
  Lake jobs) under Lean/mathlib `v4.32.0`. The generated one-file
  checkpoint is current (100 source modules), and both declaration axiom
  audits report only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`; the
  applicable project source scan finds no `sorry`, `admit`, project `axiom`,
  `unsafe`, `native_decide`, or resource-limit override.
- Remote status: `QUEUED`. No returned source has been merged; any result
  remains subject to exact-statement, source-gap, and canonical Lean 4.32
  compilation audit before comparison or adoption.
- Disposition: local canonical declarations accepted; remote work retained
  only as an independent pending validation.

## O31: finite linear base-fibre expansion proof attempt

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-15 22:44. The authenticated Aristotle dashboard
  request is `7c9f5ec5-0c4b-4066-9c24-9401e6e81444`.
- Exact task boundary: attempt only the planned local theorem
  `SequenceLift.exists_baseFiberExpansionIso_of_finite_linear`, from public
  `main` at `cf6af2473b05e0919926c8ad5a9cc084236d6c63`. The requested
  claim is that one finite linear canonical base fibre is isomorphic to the
  private-vertex expansion of a finite `SimpleGraph.NonInducedFactor` of
  `G`; it must preserve triple incidence and may not strengthen the factor
  to an induced one.
- Submitted files: none. Aristotle received only the public repository
  reference and the bounded candidate statement; no local tree, attachment,
  credential, secret, or private project content was uploaded.
- Required outcome: either a focused, compile-checked patch in a disposable
  clone or the exact current-API obstruction plus a smallest checked front
  lemma. The prompt prohibits commits, pushes, merges, global fibre claims,
  trace/avoidance/atom/constructibility conclusions, `sorry`, `admit`,
  project axioms, `unsafe`, `native_decide`, `implemented_by`, and
  resource-limit overrides.
- Remote status: `QUEUED`. No returned source has been merged; any result
  remains subject to exact-statement, source-gap, and canonical Lean 4.32
  compilation audit before comparison or adoption.
- Disposition: the N1 theorem remains planned and unproved locally; remote
  work is a bounded proof attempt rather than evidence for any broader claim.

## O32: dynamic base-fibre incidence-forest audit

- Completed: 2026-07-16 07:49 on the authenticated Aristotle dashboard.
  The request is `bc362149-d9ba-4378-a0d0-022ef752bdb7`.
- Exact task boundary: provide a bounded, compile-checked dynamic-pruning
  incidence-forest leaf lemma and an exact `SequenceLift` bridge, without
  claiming the full coherent ordering theorem.
- Returned artifacts:
  `SequenceLiftBaseFiberSupportIncidenceForestOrder.lean`,
  `SequenceLiftBaseFiberSupportIncidenceForestOrder.patch`, and
  `PROOF_DESIGN_REPORT.md`.
- Reported checked declarations: `SimpleGraph.setFamilyIncidenceGraph`,
  `SimpleGraph.IsAcyclic.exists_left_leaf_of_right_two_neighbors`,
  `SequenceLift.baseFiberSupportIncidenceGraph`, and
  `SequenceLift.exists_activeBaseFiber_leaf_in_dynamic_incidence`. The report
  explicitly permits common-apex stars with high fibre degree.
- Reported verification: focused compilation completed successfully (1,592
  Lake jobs), and the principal theorem axiom reports contain only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`; the report identifies no prohibited
  construct.
- Exact remaining work reported by Aristotle: recursively assemble the order
  over `Q.erase q`, then turn leaf-neighbour uniqueness into equality of
  nonempty support intersections using
  `baseFiber_support_inter_subsingleton_of_linear`.
- Local disposition: advisory and superseded as a whole-file patch. Public
  `main` at `f77f2e3e5cce3eb94708b9388574d62725061f02` already contains the
  stronger, independently checked
  `SequenceLiftBaseFiberSupportIncidenceForestOrderBridge.lean`. No returned
  source was merged, and Terra must not overwrite that bridge. Individual new
  lemmas may be considered only after an exact diff, dependency, source-gap,
  banned-construct, focused-build, and axiom audit.

## O33: conditional incidence-acyclic endpoint audit

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-16 06:31 (the authenticated dashboard displayed
  09:31 in the local Europe/Kiev session). The request is
  `b34d691a-03d2-4b4d-a830-869e1a5c909f`.
- Exact task boundary: independently implement and validate only the three
  N14 conditional endpoint declarations in
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/SequenceLiftBaseFiberSupportIncidenceForestOrderEndpoints.lean`
  from public `main` at `d9b6ce1482ebc86e1b61dbaba02eae4e2f97478e`. The
  required imports are exactly the incidence-forest bridge, running-order
  endpoints, and finite-lift-generation module. The prompt expressly forbids
  any attempt to prove or assume the stronger finite-linear incidence
  acyclicity theorem.
- Submitted files: none. Aristotle received only the public repository
  reference, public commit, bounded theorem statements, and permitted API
  names; no local tree, attachment, credential, secret, or private project
  content was uploaded.
- Required outcome: a source patch or exact API obstruction, focused
  warnings-as-errors verification, an axiom report, and a prohibited-construct
  audit. It may not commit, push, modify upstream, weaken statements, use
  `sorry`, `admit`, project axioms, `unsafe`, `native_decide`,
  `implemented_by`, or resource-limit overrides.
- Remote status: `QUEUED`. No returned source has been merged. Any result is
  advisory until checked against the exact canonical declarations and Lean
  environment locally.
- Local disposition: the independently authored N14 source is being checked
  and integrated separately; Aristotle is a bounded second proof/API audit,
  not the acceptance authority.

## O34: sequence-lift missing-bridge obstruction audit

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-16. The authenticated Aristotle project is
  `7adf363f-f766-4d57-bde6-74dc6cee4292`; its task is
  `f2aaefef-2eb6-4a1c-805a-315a22593f18`.
- Exact task boundary: add only
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/SequenceLiftMissingBridgeObstruction.lean`, proving
  `SequenceLift.not_isObligatory_of_linear_of_not_isolatedReduction_bridgeAtEveryEdge`
  for a finite linear source, a graph with no countable colouring, and a
  missing isolated-reduction Levi bridge. The required proof instantiates
  `F.IsObligatory` at `SequenceLift.system G`, applies
  `aleph0_lt_chromaticCardinal`, and contradicts the existing no-embedding
  bridge wrapper. It may not attempt the remaining odd-Berge or nonlinearity
  branches of the classification.
- Submitted files: none. Aristotle received only the public repository
  reference at `9d4ed4070d8325958def4b3d7863c52a3f22e1db`, the exact imports,
  statement, verification commands, and restriction list; no local tree,
  credential, secret, or private artifact was uploaded.
- Required verification: focused warnings-as-errors compilation, focused Lake
  build, `#print axioms`, and a prohibited-construct audit. The prompt forbids
  `sorry`, `admit`, new axioms, `unsafe`, `native_decide`, `implemented_by`,
  and resource-limit overrides.
- Remote result: `COMPLETE` on 2026-07-16. Aristotle reported creating only
  the requested module and the exact direct contradiction proof; its focused
  warnings-as-errors compilation passed, its axiom report contained only
  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`, and it reported no
  prohibited construct.
- Local disposition: no remote source was merged. Public `main` already
  contained the independently authored module in commit
  `fa66819efd7439e6226c02c5f9c2e29cb9389fab`, which was compiled, axiom-audited,
  and passed GitHub Actions. The remote result is therefore accepted only as
  an independent proof/API audit and must not overwrite the tracked source.
## O35: TriangleHost finite-linearity audit

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-16. The authenticated Aristotle project is
  `7adf363f-f766-4d57-bde6-74dc6cee4292`; its task is
  `b2b05f74-92cf-40cc-a2c3-23ce534f7b72`.
- Exact task boundary: create only the proposed module
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/TriangleHostLinearity.lean`, using 2-subsets of a
  type `κ` as vertices and 3-subsets as edges, and prove only the finite
  triple-system and linearity facts. The required finite obligations are
  3-subsets having exactly three 2-subsets, extensional simplicity, and the
  fact that two 3-subsets sharing two distinct 2-subsets are equal.
- Explicit non-goals: no Ramsey or Erdos--Rado partition theorem, no
  chromatic-cardinality theorem, no odd-Berge or sequence-lift work, and no
  classification theorem. The task must preserve a same-universe host
  representation or report a precise universe obstruction.
- Submitted files: none. Aristotle received only the public repository
  context and a bounded prompt; no local tree, credential, secret, or private
  artifact was uploaded.
- Required verification: focused warnings-as-errors compilation, focused Lake
  build, `#print axioms`, and a prohibited-construct audit. The prompt forbids
  `sorry`, `admit`, new axioms, `unsafe`, `native_decide`, `implemented_by`,
  resource-limit overrides, upstream edits, commits, and pushes.
- Remote status (2026-07-16): `RUNNING`. It is the one relevant active task;
  no queued task or idle project consumes an Aristotle worker slot. Any result
  remains advisory until an exact local source, dependency, source-gap,
  banned-construct, strict-build, axiom, self-contained, and GitHub Actions
  audit is complete.
- Local disposition (2026-07-16): the independently authored finite host layer
  was published in `06eb3c6120f56cb0587e52b14be0f4b11912673a` and passed its
  focused GitHub Actions Lean checks. The running remote audit remains
  advisory and must not overwrite that checked source.

- Status update (2026-07-16): the task subsequently reached `COMPLETE`.
  Aristotle reported the exact finite host and linearity declarations, strict
  elaboration and Lake build, a clean prohibited-construct scan, and only
  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` in its axiom reports.
  Although its report mentioned a commit/push, local Git provenance confirms
  that the module was already present in ancestor commit
  `06eb3c6120f56cb0587e52b14be0f4b11912673a`; no remote divergence or local
  Git write resulted from the audit. The result is accepted only as an
  independent advisory audit; the checked source remains the existing
  independently authored module.

## O36: N22 exact transport adversarial audit

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-16. The authenticated Aristotle project is
  `144416b7-f89a-4388-8fb5-b48fd89e5656`; its task is
  `34e128b0-388d-40d1-8c2b-e3f68e9cb95e`.
- Exact task boundary: independently audit only the existing declarations in
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/TriangleHostRamseyTransport.lean` from public `main`
  at `8b830fa` (two-sided reindexing, ULift orientation, countable-colouring
  pullback, chromatic-cardinal bridge, and the conditional nonlinearity
  endpoint). It may return a minimal correction confined to this module or an
  explicit soundness report.
- Explicit non-goals: no construction or assumption of
  `PairRamseyTriangle`, no Erdos--Rado proof, no unconditioned classification,
  and no upstream commit, push, or unrelated refactor.
- Required audit: focused warnings-as-errors elaboration and Lake build,
  endpoint `#print axioms`, and a scan for `sorry`, `admit`, `axiom`, `unsafe`,
  `native_decide`, `implemented_by`, and resource-limit overrides.
- Remote completion (2026-07-16): `COMPLETE_WITH_ERRORS` at the project level;
  its terminal response contains a substantive soundness audit, not a Lean
  error. It accepted the exact N22 declarations, found no correction, verified
  the strict/Lake checks and expected axioms, and confirmed that the assumed
  `PairRamseyTriangle` does not supply the missing Erdos--Rado theorem.
- Local disposition (2026-07-16): accepted as a bounded advisory audit only.

## O37: Erdős--Rado carrier public-source audit

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-16. The authenticated Aristotle project is
  `99e11664-be71-49f0-bc9a-a987d282340c`; its task is
  `870dff93-6f60-44eb-93ea-56087069dafd`.
- Exact task boundary: audit the public carrier module at commit
  `eb22d73`, including its exact successor-of-continuum cardinality,
  classical decidable-equality instance, explicit homogeneous-set premise,
  and conditional finite-Ramsey composition. It must verify that the module
  does not assert an Erdős--Rado partition-calculus theorem.
- Submitted files: none. Aristotle received only the public repository
  reference and exact module boundary; no local tree, credential, secret, or
  private artifact was uploaded.
- Required audit: focused warnings-as-errors elaboration and Lake build,
  endpoint `#print axioms`, and a scan for `sorry`, `admit`, `axiom`,
  `unsafe`, `native_decide`, `implemented_by`, and resource-limit
  overrides.
- Remote completion (2026-07-16): `COMPLETE_WITH_ERRORS` at the project
  label, but its terminal report is a substantive pass: it found no Lean
  error or prohibited construct, reported only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`, and confirmed the public GitHub
  Actions run for the audited commit. The error label came from an auxiliary
  command rather than the Lean audit.
- Local disposition (2026-07-16): accepted only as an independent advisory
  audit. The carrier and all later extensions remain subject to local strict
  builds, axiom checks, self-contained consistency checks, and GitHub Actions.

## O38: strengthened Erdos--Rado carrier public-source audit

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-16. The authenticated Aristotle project is
  `c6564b06-5408-48ed-a840-72f3acce317b`; its task is
  `6ff66119`. It audited the exact public `main` commit
  `96ee1baf9a2dd0f0c242d2681c73d8eddc3e0aa4`.
- Exact task boundary: audit only the strengthened carrier interface and its
  reduction in `Erdos593/TripleSystem/ErdosRadoCarrier.lean`. In particular,
  verify that `ErdosRadoUncountableHomogeneousPairSet` is a documented
  target, not an asserted partition theorem; that the reduction obtains
  infinitude from an uncountable homogeneous set; and that the triangle
  consequence remains conditional on this missing theorem-level input.
- Submitted files: none. Aristotle received only the exact public commit and
  module boundary; no local tree, credential, secret, or private artifact was
  uploaded.
- Required audit: focused warnings-as-errors elaboration and Lake build,
  endpoint `#print axioms`, public GitHub Actions confirmation, and a scan for
  `sorry`, `admit`, `axiom`, `unsafe`, `native_decide`, `implemented_by`, and
  resource-limit overrides.
- Remote completion (2026-07-16): project metadata reported
  `COMPLETE_WITH_ERRORS`, while the terminal report gave a substantive pass.
  It found the target conditional, the cardinal/universe handling and
  uncountability-to-infinitude reduction sound, no hidden partition
  assumption or prohibited construct, and only standard Lean axioms
  (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`).
- Local disposition (2026-07-16): accepted only as an independent advisory
  audit. The source remains subject to local strict builds, axiom checks,
  self-contained consistency checks, and GitHub Actions.

## O39: N24-A pair-transport public-source audit

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-16. The authenticated Aristotle project is
  `8a6e4193-3338-4c42-8539-e91ee9b727ec`; its task is
  `e72248b0-fceb-4c83-b87f-1439c1fdaf8e`. It audits exact public `main`
  commit `ceb964283efd809f129f64a8e83365ccbff1d339`.
- Exact task boundary: independently audit only
  `Erdos593/TripleSystem/ErdosRado/PairTransport.lean`: pair reindexing,
  transported colouring, image homogeneity, and same-universe image-cardinal
  transport. It must not claim an Erdos--Rado theorem or introduce one as an
  assumption.
- Submitted files: none. The request directs Aristotle to clone the named
  public commit; no local tree, credential, secret, or private artifact was
  uploaded.
- Required audit: focused warnings-as-errors elaboration and Lake build,
  endpoint `#print axioms`, and a scan for `sorry`, `admit`, `axiom`,
  `unsafe`, `native_decide`, `implemented_by`, and resource-limit overrides.
  The prompt forbids theorem weakening, hidden hypotheses, aggregate imports,
  upstream edits, commits, and pushes.
- Remote status (2026-07-16): `IN_PROGRESS`. It is the sole active N24 audit.
  Three stale continuation projects were released by cancelling their queued
  re-runs (`416f2f75-2663-43c9-ba5c-08d1d4cde184`,
  `ebb5aa4b-49eb-4bd6-a069-4b9978abe2f0`, and
  `58327fa1-fac8-48ad-9beb-6a40fa72b869`); no active stale task remains.
- GitHub Actions status (2026-07-16): GitHub's API returned HTTP 503 for both
  Actions-run and commit-check queries for this SHA. This is recorded as an
  external availability failure, not a failed Lean check; retry before taking
  any CI disposition.
- Local disposition: pending. Any Aristotle result remains advisory until the
  exact source passes local strict build, axiom, banned-construct, and
  self-contained checks and GitHub Actions become observable.

## O40: N24 full countably-coloured Erdos--Rado endpoint request

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-18 11:08. The authenticated Aristotle project is
  `a38acccf-92a5-41c1-ae37-c4cd1e90afed`.
- Local base SHA at submission: `9aae61e38a3f90baa8a2be5b308cd7581ac14394`.
- Exact task boundary: attempt the missing countably-coloured Erdos--Rado
  pair-partition endpoint for `ErdosRadoCarrier`, preferably by proving
  `ErdosRadoUncountableHomogeneousPairSet` or directly
  `PairRamseyTriangle ErdosRadoCarrier`. The prompt requires reuse of the
  existing `ErdosRado/CanonicalTrace`, `TraceExtension`, `TraceLimit`,
  `PairTransport`, and `EndhomogeneousLift` scaffolding where possible.
- Submitted files: local Lean project directory via `aristotle submit
  --project-dir .`; no plaintext API key was printed or recorded.
- Toolchain caveat: Aristotle warned that its preferred Lean toolchain is
  `leanprover/lean4:v4.28.0`, while this repository currently uses
  `leanprover/lean4:v4.32.0`. Any returned patch is advisory until it passes
  local Lean 4.32 strict checks.
- Required proof constraints: no `sorry`, `admit`, new `axiom`, `unsafe`,
  `native_decide`, `implemented_by`, `run_tac`, theorem weakening, CH
  assumption, finite-colour substitution, or hidden partition-calculus
  assumption.
- Local disposition: pending. The exact remaining local interface is now
  `ErdosRado.FullEndhomogeneousTraceForEveryColoring`, whose sufficiency for
  `ErdosRadoUncountableHomogeneousPairSet` is checked locally in
  `ErdosRado/EndhomogeneousLift.lean`.

## O41: Erdos593 shift-graph chromatic descent continuation

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-18. The authenticated Aristotle project is
  `344eb11a-5b85-4b7e-b6f2-db5268a152ab`; the active task at submission time
  is `c69d4a8e-b9f1-42e4-bae4-7b8be9304ee3`.
- Local/public base SHA at submission:
  `ea4b1300e7698108e642e8143064f114f92f98ed`.
- Exact task boundary: continue the existing shift-final request with a
  sharper target in `Erdos593/Graph/ShiftGraphChromatic.lean`: turn the
  existing one-step descent `ShiftGraph.lowerColoring` into a checked
  chromatic/cardinal lower-bound endpoint, preferably
  `ShiftGraph.not_nonempty_coloring_nat_of_beth_lt`.
- Submitted files: none in this continuation, because Aristotle rejects file
  uploads while a project is running. The prompt pins the exact public commit
  and module instead.
- Required proof constraints: no `sorry`, `admit`, new `axiom`, `unsafe`,
  `native_decide`, `implemented_by`, `run_tac`, theorem weakening,
  unexplained hypotheses, aggregate imports, unrelated refactoring, commits,
  pushes, or resource-limit overrides. If the exact endpoint is blocked by
  pinned-Mathlib cardinal APIs, Aristotle must return the smallest checked
  replacement theorem and the exact missing wrapper lemma.
- Local disposition: pending. Any returned patch is advisory until it passes
  focused local Lean, axiom, prohibited-construct, self-contained, and GitHub
  Actions checks.

## O42: Erdos593 isolated-reduction classification continuation

- Submitted (UTC): 2026-07-18. The authenticated Aristotle project is
  `8d3ff5a0-24b9-4e1b-add6-c26577ffe1a2`; the active task at submission time
  is `f0bc3334-5c1f-4ad4-ba37-ce0ba123f0bc`.
- Local/public base SHA at submission:
  `ea4b1300e7698108e642e8143064f114f92f98ed`.
- Exact task boundary: continue the current Erdos593 formalization request
  with the final negative-direction glue for the isolated-reduction
  classification. The preferred endpoint is
  `TripleSystem.isObligatory_iff_isolatedReduction_intrinsic`, with the
  reverse implication proved by contraposition from the existing nonlinearity,
  missing-bridge, and odd-Berge/shift-host obstruction modules.
- Submitted files: none in this continuation, because the project is already
  running. The prompt pins the exact public commit and names the intended
  source modules and theorem dependencies.
- Required proof constraints: no `sorry`, `admit`, new `axiom`, `unsafe`,
  `native_decide`, `implemented_by`, `run_tac`, theorem weakening, hidden
  assumptions, CH or finite-colour replacement, aggregate imports, unrelated
  refactoring, commits, pushes, or resource-limit overrides.
- Local disposition: pending. Any returned patch must preserve the
  isolated-reduction formulation and is advisory until checked locally and in
  GitHub Actions.

## Record format

For every submission, record:

- UTC timestamp and Aristotle project/task identifier;
- exact prompt and submitted file set;
- returned files and local diff;
- `lake build` result;
- remaining `sorry`/`admit`/axiom audit;
- whether the result was accepted, repaired, or rejected.
